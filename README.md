# Image-Captioning

This project generates natural language descriptions (captions) for input images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence generation.

# Project Overview

The model takes an image as input and generates a relevant caption that describes the contents of the image. The architecture combines:

1. CNN to extract visual features from the image
2. LSTM to generate the caption word-by-word based on the extracted features

# How It Works

Preprocessing:
 Captions are cleaned, tokenized, and padded
 Images are resized and converted to feature vectors using a CNN
 
Model Architecture:
 CNN Encoder: Extracts a fixed-length feature vector from an image
 LSTM Decoder: Takes the feature vector and generates a sequence of words
 
Training:
 Trained on a dataset like Flickr8k
